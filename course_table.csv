9,Introduction to the Modern Middle East,"An introduction to Middle Eastern Studies focusing on the modern period (19th and 20th centuries). Lectures will be broadly sequenced according to historical chronology but will be thematically organized. They will provide some historical context for each topic examined, as well as present specific examples through primary sources, visual sources, and numerical data when relevant.This course is designed to give students an overall good grasp of the history of the modern Middle East and of some of the major themes in modern Middle Eastern Studies. Students will critically engage with some of the most important topics that resonate in that area of the world. We will cover topics such as reformism, economic development, colonialism and nationalism, authoritarianism and democratization, sectarianism, culture, gender, literature and the arts, as well as the role of religion in politics. Most of these topics, in one way or another, will speak to the construction of nation-states in the Middle East and to the challenges they have been confronting.This is not a survey course. In particular, it will not be exhaustive in its coverage of the region in space or time, and in its coverage of topics. Students in search of a specific topic, country, or period are strongly encouraged to take a look at the syllabus prior to enrolling to make sure their specific interests will be covered.Assigned readings will consist of primary and secondary sources. Students will be exposed to first-hand accounts by protagonists in the history of the Middle East (primary sources) as well as to the diversity of approaches that the scholarly literature (secondary sources) has taken across disciplines, e.g. anthropological studies, quantitative analysis, philology and textual studies. The larger aim of the course is to develop students&rsquo; critical thinking in dealing with the history, cultures, politics, and political economies of the contemporary Middle East.

26,Sense and Scientific Sensibility,"Scientific inquiry is often considered an endeavor pursued using one's sense of vision: scientists peer into microscopes and telescopes, and stare at graphs, diagrams, and computer screens. But on what other senses do scientists rely? How do they gather data using senses of hearing, smell, taste, and touch (or, for that matter, less acknowledged perceptual systems, among them, balance, temperature, movement, pain, and time)? How do researchers evaluate sensory evidence? Further, what is the history of scientific studies of the senses? To address such questions, each week we will explore a different sense (from the canonical five to synaesthesia and ESP) by combining readings in the history of science with classic primary sources. Throughout, we will examine critical questions regarding how the senses are culturally and historically constructed, evaluated, and technologically mediated.",,N,Y,76,HISTSCI 164,2664,2014,2,7.0,4.0,57.14,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.3,-1.0,5.0

The genetic information encoded in our DNA is organized in a defined set of chromosomes, which are condensed about 10.000 fold in order to fit in the cell nucleus. This compaction occurs through packaging of the DNA around histone proteins, a structure known as chromatin. In what was thought to be a rigid structure, today we know that chromatin is an amazingly dynamic folding that plays a crucial role in controlling accessibility of factors to the DNA, and as such, it regulates a vast number of critical biological functions, including gene transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair and cellular identity. In this course we will attempt to cover some of the basic molecular mechanisms that play a role in regulating chromatin dynamics, and in turn how chromatin itself modulate biological processes, including basic mechanisms of inheritance. We will specifically discuss the role of DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome dynamics and novel epigenetic modulators in the context of different biological processes for which chromatin accessibility appears to play a crucial role.",,N,Y,84,CELLBIO 307QC,3024,2015,2,25.0,12.0,48.0,4.6,4.5,4.4,4.5,4.5,3.3,-1.0,4.7

192,Why We Animals Sing,"We do not sing alone. On land, four kinds of animals produce songs or calls: birds, frogs, mammals, and insects. Some of these (and fish) also do so underwater. The principal sounds such animal species make are signaling behaviors directly related to mating success. They are of individuals, usually males, marking territories, and wooing mates. However, in any one location, species may also compete with one another for occupation of acoustic space (that is, for bandwidth) and otherwise optimize their sound signals to features of their environment. We will explore these topics and others as we listen to and read about each of the various kinds of singers on earth, the biology of their sound production and reception, and the ways they attract mates while avoiding becoming meals for eavesdropping predators. We will listen to many different kinds of acoustic signalers across a wide array of acoustic communities in tropical and temperate settings, both terrestrial and aquatic, and we will examine sound spectra on a large screen as we listen and slow down and isolate sounds to help distinguish their parts. Finally, we will consider the biology and evolution of music in humans, considering evidence from brain studies, archaeology and anthropology, and the music of indigenous peoples. We will look at music parallels in different kinds in animals of other species. There will be field trips to listen to and record assemblages of local species. The overall objective is to awaken the students&rsquo; sense, understanding, and appreciation of the acoustic environment from which we come, and the role of this environment in shaping human biology and culture.

We will consider the rights and problems around the passage of legislation arguing for the return of objects to Native American tribes in the United States. We will grapple with the very mission of archaeology as we study tombstones in Harvard's own backyard, investigating the challenges faced by archaeologists as they collect and interpret often apparently scant, fragile, and historically distant data.

376,Trials from Ancient Athens,"In classical Athens, litigants represented themselves before hundreds of jurors who rendered verdicts without instruction from a judge. Although Athens is often praised for its participatory political institutions, the best-known example of Athenian justice is an embarrassment: the trial and execution of Socrates. Was the Athenian legal system a shining example of the potential of popular, democratic justice, or a cautionary tale suggesting that law is best left to experts? We will evaluate Athens&rsquo; distinctively amateur legal system by reading surviving court speeches involving homicide, assault, adultery, prostitution, slander, treason, citizenship, property and commerce, as well as Plato&rsquo;s account of Socrates&rsquo; defense speech. We will analyze the speeches as pieces of legal rhetoric and for the insight they offer into ancient approaches to crime and punishment, the regulation of sexuality (rape, adultery, prostitution, homosexuality), the trial jury, court procedure, and commercial law. Taught by a law professor, the focus will be on comparing ancient and modern approaches to problems faced by all legal systems.

378,"The American Death Penalty: Morality, Law, and Politics","This seminar will address the controversies that swirl around the American death penalty in the distinct but related contexts of morality, law, and politics. At the level of moral theory, we will consider whether the death penalty is ever justified as a state practice, both in the abstract and in application, given concerns about its fairness and efficacy in deterring crime. We will explore the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s &ldquo;constitutionalization&rdquo; of capital punishment starting with its landmark decision in 1972 in the case of Furman v. Georgia. We will trace the Court&rsquo;s attempt to deal with issues of fair process, proportionality, cruelty, reliability, and racial discrimination. Close readings of key opinions will show how the Court&rsquo;s interpretation of the majestic generalities of the Constitution&mdash;the guarantees of &ldquo;due process&quot;, &ldquo;equal protection,&rdquo; and protection from &ldquo;cruel and unusual punishments&rdquo;&mdash;have been informed by moral theory. Finally, we will consider the American death penalty in political context, both nationally and internationally. We will assess explanations for the anomaly of American retention of capital punishment, alone among Western democracies. We will consider how moral philosophy and legal regulation have affected the course of the American death penalty in the political sphere and contemplate the legal and political future of the institution.

393,Scenography Studio,"Theater designers use figures, space, objects, time and light to create environments that are integral to performance events. The potential for action and the integration with the performance as a whole is key to the design process. Like any artist, the designer needs to create visual studies to explore possibilities and communicate ideas. In Scenography Studio students will respond to architecture, photography, fiction, painting, sculpture, etc., to develop a series of performance design projects. In the course of developing these projects, students will gain skills in a variety of digital and manual media as well as study significant 20th and 21st century artists and theorists.

411,Origins of the Food We Eat,"The most significant lifestyle revolution in the human past was the change from hunting and gathering to agriculture and pastoralism. That shift in the subsistence base has facilitated, and has been facilitated by, increasing populations and a restructuring of social and economic relations over the past 10,000 years. Focusing on key geographic areas and transformative time periods, we discuss how this process began by focusing on the domestication of what have become the staples and major condiments of modern diets around the world. We also consider the spread and adoption of domestic plants and animals across the Eastern and Western Hemispheres as well as the globalization of food that began at the end of the 15th century CE with the Columbian Exchange.To study the processes of domestication and subsequent exploitation of domestic plants and animals requires a multi-disciplinary approach. Thus we sample contributions from a wide range of fields including archaeology, anthropology, history, linguistics, botany, zoology, genetics, biogeochemistry, climatology, geomorphology, oceanography, demography, and nutritional science.

420,Food for Thought: Culinary Culture in Spain and Beyond,"The French have said that the history of a nation depends on what they eat. Yet in the case of Spain, it&rsquo;s clearly the reverse. What Spain has eaten has been a consequence of the country&rsquo;s vast -and often turbulent- history. Invasions, expansions, exile and immigration have created and continue to create the cuisine and culture, which will be our focus in this seminar. Likewise, we will consider Spain&rsquo;s culinary exchange with Latin America, with specific reference to Argentina, Peru and the Caribbean. From don Quijote&rsquo;s rudimentary repas, to Almod&oacute;var&rsquo;s gazpacho, we&rsquo;ll conclude at the tables of the globalized metropolis. We will first consider food and identity, then food, its rituals and traditions. We will examine Spain from the Middle Ages until the present, the history and regions of the peninsula, and the culinary consequences of transatlantic voyages. We will also consider the repercussions of Europeans arriving in the 19th century, and those of the many closer, traumatic events of the 20th century, and beyond. The readings, all in English, are by novelists, historians, chefs, food critics, sociologists, poets, cartoonists and travel writers over the span of ten centuries. The films and videos are more recent, and will have subtitles. No previous knowledge of Spanish language, or travel to any of the countries mentioned, is required. Neither do prospective students need extensive cooking skills.

We will then examine the inadequacies and inconsistencies in our current picture, including for example the problem of quantum gravity, the lack of a unified theory of forces, Dirac&rsquo;s large numbers problem, the cosmological constant problem, Hawking&rsquo;s black hole information paradox, and the absence of a theory for the origin of the universe. Attempts to address these issues and move beyond our current understanding involve a network of intertwined investigations in string theory, M theory, inflation and non-abelian gauge theories and have drawn inspiration from the study of black holes and developments in modern mathematics.

428,Introduction to Social Movements,"Social movements and revolution have long been driving forces behind political, social, and cultural change. From the Civil Rights movement of the 60s to the recent and unpredicted ""Arab Spring,"" the extraordinary mobilization of ordinary people is routinely credited with fundamentally re-shaping societal institutions--the polity, the economy, religion, gender, race, and even the environment. But can we really define and study something as ephemeral as social mobilization? Do we know how social movements begin? Why might they become revolutionary? Can they make a difference in the societies they target? This course examines these questions within the sociological literature on collective action. Theories of social movements and revolutions are then applied to a series of case studies around the globe. Case studies may include the US, Iran, China, El Salvador, Chile, India, Poland, Argentina, Egypt, and Nigeria, among others.

509,The Politics of Storytelling,"This course addresses Hannah Arendt's thesis that storytelling is a critical strategy for bridging the gap between private and public realms. Storytelling is thus understood as a mode of social and political activity that involves a struggle between personal and collective representations of the ""truth"" and between unofficial and official versions of events. Through the close analysis of storytelling in a variety of situations, we will explore the ways in which the meaning of stories resides not in any ahistorical essence or internal logic, but emerges from the everyday human struggle to strike a balance between domains of experience that are, on the one hand, felt to belong to oneself or one's own kind, and, on the other, felt to be shared by or to belong to others.",,Y,N,160,RELIGION 1920,11256,2015,1,5.0,5.0,100.0,4.6,5.0,4.6,4.2,4.4,2.2,-1.0,4.6

511,What is the History of Medicine?,"The emergence of the science of medicine and its professionalization have been integral aspects of human history. The history of medicine allows us to trace the various traditions that have come together to create ""modern medicine."" In this section, students will examine the human endeavor to be healthy and to cure disease. The practice of medicine draws on changing ideas about the natural world and the body. It also demands interventions in the physical environment so as to maximize public health, and readily incorporates transformative technologies from other sectors of human society. Students will be asked to reflect on the interaction of medicine and culture through questions such as: How did western powers use biomedicine in the context of empire? How do non-western cultures appropriate and indigenize biomedicine?",,N,Y,72,HIST 97A,10917,2015,2,7.0,7.0,100.0,3.3,3.4,2.7,2.9,3.5,4.8,-1.0,3.4
512,What is Intellectual History?,"Intellectual historians study almost every period, place, and theme in human history: from classical times to the present, from Asia to the Americas, by examining philosophy and religion, social and political thought, literature and art, and other expressions of human agency and intention that range from ancient epics to graphic novels.

514,What is the History of History?,"Everything has a history, and the discipline of history has a particularly long and broad one. In this section we'll focus on ideas about how and why to study history and on the practices of historical research and writing as they have varied across different cultural contexts. In selected case studies we will consider who wrote and who read history, and how historians answered questions that we also ask ourselves today. E.g. What features are essential to a good historical account? Does the study of history teach moral lessons? How does history interact with memory?",,N,Y,72,HIST 97C,10919,2015,2,15.0,12.0,80.0,4.1,3.8,3.8,4.6,4.5,7.9,-1.0,3.8
515,What is Environmental History?,"This section gives new History concentrators an introduction to environmental history. Most historians leave the natural world out of the story, but environmental historians regard nature as the inescapable context for human history, including the human impact on nature. We will explore how the histories of the environment and of humans can (and perhaps should) be written together. Is there a ""natural archive"" which historians can consult in parallel with conventional libraries and archives? Do places have ""biographies,"" just as people do? Can natural entities (mountains, dogs, rivers, microbes, climate) have ""agency"" in the same way human actors can?",,N,Y,72,HIST 97D,10920,2014,2,8.0,8.0,100.0,4.5,4.2,4.2,4.9,4.8,8.0,-1.0,4.5
516,What is Material History?,"This section offers new History concentrators an overview of the history and anthropology of material culture. Our coverage will range widely across both time and space; major themes will include things created in the deep human past as well as the habits of consumption and even addiction that define our relationship with things in the present day. Do we own things? Or do things own us? Does having more stuff necessarily lead to happiness? Readings will offer students a chance to work not just with history and historical sources, but also art history, literary studies, archaeology, environmental history, and cognitive neuroscience.",,N,Y,72,HIST 97F,10922,2014,2,8.0,8.0,100.0,3.9,2.9,3.6,4.1,4.3,7.5,-1.0,3.8

523,The Call of Beauty,"Across the centuries, philosophers, poets, scientists, and mathematicians have meditated on the nature and power of beauty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have said beauty calls on us to educate ourselves; others have said it is a call to repair the injuries of the world. Our readings will come from both men and women: Plato and Sappho in ancient Greece; Aquinas and Lady Murasaki in the medieval period; Rilke and Maya Lin today.&nbsp; We will study features associated with beauty such as color (e.g. &ldquo;The Lady and the Unicorn&rdquo; tapestries depicting the five senses) and symmetry (e.g. Augustine&rsquo;s De Musica; a book on symmetry by astrophysicist Mario Livio; a recorded debate among physicists about math and beauty).&nbsp; Does the call of beauty change according to its location? Among the sites we will contemplate are the beauty of earth (e.g. the writings of environmentalist Rachel Carson; the ephemeral sculptures of Andy Goldsworthy) and the beauty of faces (such as Homer on Helen, Seamus Heaney on an unnamed soldier).",Course open to Freshman Students Only,N,Y,56,FRSEMR 39N,10828,2014,2,10.0,8.0,80.0,4.5,4.6,4.2,4.5,4.8,3.1,-1.0,4.5
524,"Humans, Technology, and Biopolitics","Recent scientific and technological advances are increasingly questioning what it means to be human. Debates on life extension, gene editing, and artificial intelligence regularly appear in the media, with views ranging from techno-optimism&mdash;the idea that such breakthroughs will deliver us from suffering&mdash;to the warnings that technoscience is advancing at such a rapid pace, that there is not enough time for ethical guidelines to be developed. Some argue that science is increasingly delivering on the promises traditionally made by Judeo-Christian religions, while others assert that such techno-optimist thinking is a kind of new religion in and of itself. Debates around emerging technologies cut across traditional political lines, making them specifically biopolitical, where such issues as human enhancement, control of reproduction,&nbsp; genetic engineering, and many others, create new types of political positions and actors. This course will examine these issues, focusing specifically on what concepts of &ldquo;the human&rdquo; emerge from these debates, and how certain ideas about the future affect how we live and manage our time now, as futurist discourses are producing affective states of both hope and fear. Among the case studies for this course, we will look at the cultural and philosophical movements of transhumanism and posthumanism, new utopian and eschatological imaginaries, as well as ethical and legal questions of developing and using biomedical technologies, including their non-therapeutic use. As we proceed, we will pay particular attention to the shifting relations between body and person, human and time, transcendence and corporality, and technology and biology, while discussing how they contribute to the rethinking of the human condition in the technological age. Materials for the course will include academic pieces from a range of disciplines: STS, anthropology, philosophy, bioethics, as well as non-academic media sources, documentaries, and science fiction films.",,Y,N,136,SOC-STD 98OC,11154,2015,2,4.0,2.0,50.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,5.5,-1.0,3.5

The core objective of the course is to develop simple macroeconomic models of open economies that can be usefully applied to international economic phenomena. We will examine the balance of payments, the determination of exchange rates, the effect of fiscal and monetary policies under fixed and floating exchange rate regimes, balance of payment crisis, international macroeconomic dependence, financial globalization, and the challenges facing developing economies. Recent issues such as the crisis in the Euro area and the sustainability of the Euro, the global transmission of the financial crisis, global imbalances, China's exchange rate policy, among others, will receive attention.

532,Ancient Lives,"What are the essential elements of human society? Have our fundamental conditions developed, and how? Can we use themes from ancient history to think about contemporary society and culture? These questions are in focus in this course on 'Ancient Lives', which explores the earliest human civilizations in the region commonly known as Mesopotamia (c. 3000-300 bce) in what is now Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Few elements in the way we live and organize ourselves today are to be taken for granted. There is, and has always been, a wealth of ways in which humans live. But biologically we are the same as our ancestors of 5000 years ago, at the dawn of history. Any likeness or difference between 'us and them' is therefore likely to be a product of history and culture. 'Ancient Lives' builds upon this realization to inspire a critical way of thinking about society in the broadest possible scope. Areas explored during the course are selected for their relevance across the range of contemporary life - they include freedom, music, public health, food, jurisprudence, trade, the visual arts, science, sexuality, religion and political power. You learn about how societies and individuals have dealt with change on multiple levels, from large-scale societal revolutions to personal transformation. Having taken this course, you will have gained a fundamental understanding and appreciation of human life in the broadest scope, as well as of your own life as a part of history. You will be able to critically assess contemporary discourses on the study of 'the other' in past and present; engage with core concepts of human society, such as justice, beauty, value and belief on a broad historical base; be familiar with examples of classical social theory and thinkers through concrete cases in which their work has been applied to or shaped by the study of the past; and acquire skills in presenting scholarly work to a general audience.",,Y,N,101,ANE 103,11046,2015,1,52.0,46.0,88.46,4.4,4.2,4.3,4.2,3.9,4.2,-1.0,4.5

Every week, we will focus a different form of representational media, from propaganda posters, photography, radio broadcasting, and cinema, to television, video piracy, and the Internet. We will ask question such as: How have media technologies changed contemporary Chinese culture and society? Were they instruments of totalitarian control, commodities of market capitalism, or tools of resistance and independent expression? How did the mass media affect perception, experiences, and memories of socialism and postsocialism, as well as the periods' cultural forms and aesthetics? What is specific or special about each medium, and how do different types of media interact in the Chinese context? While analyzing media texts, we will also consider their sociopolitical, institutional, and technological as well as engage with media theories and explore untapped historical sources.",,N,Y,32,EAFM 222,12262,2014,2,17.0,14.0,82.35,3.9,4.4,4.0,4.6,4.0,8.3,-1.0,3.9

705,Statistical Learning,"This course is all about Statistical Learning techniques in Psychology and related fields. Statistical Learning is a modern discipline of Statistics which involves developments from the fields of Statistics (obviously), Machine Learning, Computer and Data Science. Overall it refers to a vast set of tools for understanding complex data. The first series of lectures covers basic regression techniques for categorical data (ordinal and multinomial logit models) as well as advanced techniques such as causal models (propensity score matching), spatial regression, censored regression (tobit), nonlinear regression (generalized additive models), regularization and shrinkage methods (Ridge, LASSO), and generalized estimation equation (GEE) for longitudinal/correlational data. Another lecture series deals with clustering techniques such as hierarchical clustering, k-means, BIRCH, and mixture models (e.g. latent class analysis). The mixture model approach will then be embedded into a regression context in order to estimate regression models with unobserved heterogeneity (latent class regression). Finally, there will be a unit on functional data analysis (FDA) where each single observation is described by a function (e.g. eye tracking data, brain imaging data).",,N,Y,124,PSY 3450,12598,2014,2,15.0,8.0,53.33,4.9,4.6,4.6,5.0,4.8,3.4,-1.0,5.0

The course analyzes how different ""racial formations,"" incorporating different combinations of indigenous, African, and European peoples and their descendants, have developed in Latin America since colonial times. Through the systematic comparison of several cases, the course discusses how ideas of race and nation have interacted in Latin America, shaping opportunities for mobilization and public policies; how racial identities have been formed and invoked for different cultural and political purposes; and how ideas of race and ethnicity have contributed to the stratification of Latin American societies, which are among the most unequal in the world. A final section looks at the creation of transnational networks of cooperation by indigenous and black activists and how their exchanges have shaped ideas of race and forms of mobilization in their respective societies. Students in this class will have the opportunity to meet with the authors of some of the works we are reading.",,Y,Y,1,AFRAMER 219,12212,2014,2,10.0,3.0,30.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.3,-1.0,5.0

1077,"Central Challenges of American National Security, Strategy, and the Press","Using a series of case studies from the front page, and from the most urgent issues on the U.S. national security agenda, this course will engage students in grappling with the hardest American national security challenges of the decade ahead. Issues range from the Arab Awakening and intervention in civil wars to combating Iran's nuclear ambitions and dealing with the economic and military rise of China. Assignments require strategic thinking: analyzing dynamics of issues and developing strategies in a government whose deliberations are discombobulated by leaks, reports about internal differences among policymakers, and press analyses. Students will learn to devise strategies and write strategic options memos as participants in the policymaking process. Strategic options memos combine careful analysis and strategic imagination, on the one hand, with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support, on the other. A subtheme of the course explores coping with a world where a pervasive press makes secrecy more often the exception than the rule. In each case, there will be exploration of how media coverage affects decision making, with an examination of WikiLeaks, the revelations about drones and secret, American-led cyberattacks, and other examples of the publication of classified information.

In this class, we will discuss how to design data systems and algorithms that can ""scale up"" and ""scale out"". Scale up refers to the ability to use a single machine to all its potential, i.e., to exploit properly the memory hierarchy and the multiple CPU and GPU cores. Scale out refers to the ability to use more than 1 machines (typically 100s or 1000s) effectively. This is a research oriented class. Every week we will read two modern research papers; one from the scale up area and one from the scale out area. We will use examples from several areas, including relational systems and distributed databases, graph processing systems (i.e., for social networks), key value stores, noSQL and newSQL systems as well as mobile computing.

1204,Athenian Democracy and its Critics,"This course will open up ancient political thought and contemporary democratic theory through close study of Athenian politics and ideology and of the philosophical response. The ancient Athenians invented an unusually successful type of political regime and were remarkably self-conscious about what they were trying to do and how and why it worked. An important feature of their democracy was a largely sustained openness to ideas. The execution of Socrates was the exception not the rule, and dissent thrived in Athens. The philosophical work of Plato and Aristotle did not occur in isolation of or separation from the politics of the city. To an important extent, the ancient critics of Athens were also trying to cure it of what they saw as its failings. A study of key ancient Greek thinkers as critics of the democracy shines valuable light on their political theory generally. Importantly, it is only with the moderns&mdash;the Federalist Papers, Constant, Mill, Berlin, and even Rawls&mdash;that we find purely apolitical and theoretical criticism of ancient Athens. Their target is the Athenian ideal of political equality. By extending our study of critics of Athenian democracy into the contemporary period, we gain new insight about the place of the ideal of political equality in contemporary democratic theory and theories of justice.",,N,Y,70,GOV 2036,13465,2015,2,10.0,9.0,90.0,4.6,4.7,4.2,4.0,5.0,5.2,-1.0,4.4

1672,Poverty and Development,"We will consider a number of important questions in the field of development economics: Why are some countries so rich and others so poor? What factors have determined which countries prosper? Which are the root causes and which are the proximate causes of economic underdevelopment? Can these factors be changed with specific economic policies? If so, what are they and how are they best implemented? Are there country-specific characteristics that determine economic fate? Or, is prosperity just the result of luck? Does the enjoyment of the rich somehow depend on the continuing suffering of the poor? We will consider these questions and more. The course is intended to not only provide a general overview of the dominant views about economic development and policy, but to also provide students a sense of the most recent research in the field. For this reason, the course will go beyond the usual textbook summary of the field. Students will also examine recent journal articles that have made important contributions to the field of development economics.

1845,"Proofs, Beliefs and Algorithms through the lens of Sum of Squares","In this graduate seminar we will cover recent research on the use of mathematical programming for problems arising from optimization, machine learning, computational complexity and more, with a particular focus on the Parrilo-Lasserre &quot;Sum of Squares&quot; semidefinite programming hierarchy. We will discuss both lower and upper bounds, as well as how such mathematical programs give rise to a general theory of computational difficulty, computation vs. sample size tradeoffs, and computational analogs of Bayesian probabilities.More concretely, we will touch some of the following topics:* Upper and lower bounds for various average case problems, including random constraint satisfaction, planted clique, and problems arising from machine learning.* Speeding up Sum of Squares algorithms.* Relation to Khot&#39;s Unique Games&nbsp; Conjecture (UGC) and the SOS approach to refuting the UGC.* Can SoS be optimal algorithm in some settings? What are the&nbsp; candidate algorithms who could do better? In what settings might *linear* programming already be optimal?

The Cold War roots of 'brainwashing' - both the myth and the reality -- lie in the politics of twentieth-century anti-Communism and the deeper fear that people's most strongly held thoughts, ideas, and ideological commitments could be vulnerable to powerful infiltration. In order to understand the dynamics of this process we will examine case studies beginning with the Korean War-era emergence of the term 'brainwashing', the American interdisciplinary science of ""coercive persuasion"" that arose in response, and successive waves of technological, political, and sociocultural developments. We will also look at how brainwashing and analogous persuasive techniques may operate among larger groups, crowds, organizations, and mass societies.",,N,Y,76,HISTSCI 176,2668,2014,2,103.0,82.0,79.61,3.3,3.8,3.8,3.9,3.8,3.0,-1.0,3.6

3065,"How Did I Get Here? Appreciating ""Normal"" Child Development","Understanding &quot;normal&quot; growth and development may seem like a relatively easy task at first. We take the nuances of developmental differences for granted because we&#39;re so accustomed to experiencing them. Nevertheless, defining normal (versus abnormal) development is a complex and controversial task. Development involves a tricky intermingling of environmental stimuli, cultural and social expectations, rapid and not always intuitive changes in brain development, temperamental differences, genetic inheritance, and mind-boggling brain plasticity. The course will start with a consideration of general themes and then move to a chronologic perspective. First, we approach child development as a dynamic force, one which simultaneously engages multiple domains: social/relational, cognitive, physical, moral. We will then switch to examine stages of development in sequence, using our understanding of neurobiological, physical, cultural, and psychological factors to inform our assessment of how children change over time.

Why do women seem to suffer more than men from depression and eating disorders, whereas men use and abuse substances more than women? Why do some race/ethnic groups have better or worse health and mental health outcomes than others? These are some of the questions this course addresses. Using interdisciplinary perspectives we will investigate how such social and personal characteristics as gender, race/ethnicity, family background, and self-esteem impact health and mental health behaviors and outcomes. We will also examine how specific configurations of circumstances and contexts contribute to health and mental health problems. For instance, college students, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, etc., are increasingly experiencing stress and turning to amphetamines at higher rates than young adults who are not in college. One goal in these classes will be to explore causes and consequences. Another will be to understand the role of individuals themselves, their personal and social support networks, and health care professionals in developing and guiding positive strategies for coping and healing. Throughout, we traverse the boundary between health and illness in order to understand the complex web of factors that create and jeopardize well-being.

3165,Literary Theory in Comparison - An Introduction,"This course explores the relationship between theory and practice in literary terms. What is &quot;theory,&quot; and why should it concern itself with literature? We&rsquo;ll be positing that for literature, reading and writing are co-extensive: literary theory is part and parcel of the field it seeks to analyze; literature is continuously seeking to elaborate its own theory. During the semester, we will be reading literary theory as a literary genre and literary texts as reflections on theory. We will shed light on these questions through a range of literary and critical texts, which we will bring into comparison. We will consider three pairings: first, Virginia Woolf&#39;s novel Orlando (1928) with her essay A Room of One&#39;s Own (1929); then, Honor&eacute; de Balzac&#39;s short story Sarrasine (1830) with its extensive commentary by Roland Barthes in S/Z (1970); finally, Jose Luis Borges&#39;s anthology of short-story Fictions (1944) with Michel Foucault&#39;s The Order of Things (1966).By engaging with these six seminal works, the course offers a focused yet comprehensive overview of some of the issues debated by literary theorists: authorship, style, gender, class, interpretation, semiotics, inter-textuality, plurality, books, libraries, knowledge and language. The students will learn how any given reading of a literary work can in fact be read as a &quot;theoretical&quot; piece; and how, in turn, theoretical criticism might be fruitfully analyzed as a work belonging to literary writing.&nbsp;",,N,Y,24,COMPLIT 110,13542,2015,2,8.0,3.0,37.5,4.3,4.7,4.0,4.0,4.5,6.0,-1.0,4.3

It examines complex meanings, everyday practices, and rituals of masculinities in various societies both at the level of important social institutions as well as at the level of lived experiences of individual men (and some women). During the first half of the semester, we will focus on the making and remaking of ""hegemonic masculinity"" in the modern West, which had global ramifications, and compare it with marginalized masculinities. During the second half of the semester, we will focus on how major social institutions construct and maintain hegemonic masculinity and to what extent it is subverted or challenged; we will also examine how masculinities as symbols of dominance shape workings of the major institutions. Examples of such institutions include the military, the family, the school, business firms/organizations, and entertainment and leisure industry. Throughout this line of inquiry, we will look into the binary and hierarchical gender relations and explore an alternative to this dominant construction of gender.",,N,Y,137,SOCIOL 149,12634,2014,2,6.0,1.0,16.67,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,-1.0,4.0

This course explores the intersection of machine learning and social science and aims to answer a few questions about these new techniques: (i) How do they work and what kinds of statistical guarantees can be made about their performance? (ii) How can they be used to answer questions that interest social science researchers, such as testing theories or improving social policy; and (iii) How might they open up new research questions? We will cover standard machine learning techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning, statistical learning theory and nonparametric and Bayesian approaches. The goal is to create a working understanding of when and how they can be profitably applied. Students will be required to apply some of these techniques themselves, but we will not cover the computational aspects of the underlying methods.

3721,Strategy and Crisis,"The moment of crisis is the moment of discrimination: it forces decisions of obvious consequence, pitting rival theories and their proponents against one another. The crisis is par excellence the moment at which theory and practice meet. This course offers two analytical perspectives based on the study of twelve crises that are frequently seen as turning points in the modern era. To contextualize each crisis, be it political, economic, military, or a combination, we explore what the dominant theories were at the time and how they were deployed in practice in the heat of the crisis. (We may think of this a vertical, historically oriented axis of understanding.) Then we examine the linkages between crises. Are there modes of behavior or thought that are of general utility in such moments? Can strategic thought ever truly claim to be universally applicable. (We may think of this as a horizontal, thematic axis of understanding.) The course at its core is an argument for bringing history back into the core of strategic thought.",,N,Y,72,HIST 1995,12748,2014,2,22.0,19.0,86.36,4.9,4.5,4.4,4.2,5.0,6.7,-1.0,4.8

Lectures will be on the socio-cultural, historical, political, and philosophical contexts within which the texts, their writers' lives, their customs, their worldviews were embedded. Readings include original texts in translation and parallel scholarly commentaries. Students will read diverse genres of writing including biographies, memorials, poetry, songs, letters, fictional prose, travelogues, memoirs, folklore, and p'ansori. Some of our literary texts may perfectly fit our understanding of what a literary text is supposed to be, while others will challenge us to expand the boundaries of what we define as literature. The course aims to uncover sensibilities that constituted what Koreans during this period perceived as literary and literature-like.

The first history begins from the remote past, covering the evolution of political, religious and ideological institutions on the Tibetan plateau from the 7th century until the present.

The close intermingling of these two histories - and the frequent pretense of one as the other - makes ""Tibet"" uniquely useful in our understanding the very nature of the humanistic inquiry that we call history. Instead of looking at the Tibetan plateau as a self-sufficient unit of historical analysis, this course situates the Tibetan plateau between China, India, Central Asia, Western Asia and the ""West."" Specifically, students will be introduced to themes such as: the changing domains of the Tibetan cultural areas; Buddhism's historical and historiographical conquests of Tibet; the usefulness of the vocabulary ""Golden"" as well as ""Dark"" ages in linear historical narratives; the process of consecration of historical persons such as Songtsen Gampo and the Dalai Lamas; the subjugation of and resistence to Tibet as a part of ""Chinese"" history; the highly contextual representations of Tibet and Tibetan history.

In the case of premodern Japan, the aesthetic and technological developments that produce new forms of material culture are often mirrored in literature, and vice versa. Therefore this course is designed as a survey of both premodern Japanese literature (in English translation) from the 8th through 19th centuries, and of the material and visual culture of those same eras. This course aims to explore the correspondences and differences among various texts and objects in premodern Japan,and in doing so introduce students to the possibilities of a multidisciplinary approach to scholarship in the humanities.",,N,Y,36,JAPNLIT 141,12764,2014,2,1.0,1.0,100.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,-1.0,5.0

3767,Sexuality and Political Economy,"This seminar explores the complex links between sexuality, capitalism, and power. Sexuality has long represented a central domain for the creation and contestation of subjects and sovereignties, labor and capital, relatedness and belonging, desire and development, security and violence. With the publication of Michel Foucault&rsquo;s The History of Sexuality (1976), the role of modern forms of power that work to discipline subjects and regulate populations has become central to how scholars conceptualize sexuality. By comparison, however, the relation between sexuality, the capitalist economy, and the myriad forms of postcolonial sovereignties has only recently become the topic of rigorous analysis. In this seminar, we revisit classic works by Freud, Foucault, Lacan and Fanon as well as texts in feminist, queer and postcolonial theories in order to craft a conceptual vocabulary for understanding emerging configurations of sex and politics in late capitalism. We ask: Under what historical circumstances does sexuality become a marker of inclusion, exclusion or exceptionalism in relation to race, ethnicity, culture, and state politics? What are the relations between commodities, discourses of sexuality, and the erotic practices of concrete historical actors? And what do we learn about globalization when we think of sexuality as a central domain of economic production, social reproduction, and political belonging?",,N,Y,6,ANTHRO 2614,12821,2015,2,22.0,16.0,72.73,4.7,4.8,4.4,4.5,4.5,7.5,-1.0,4.7

Some scholars have debated whether African religious, musical, medical and communitarian practices were reproduced in the New World or whether they were creolized through fusion with other (European and indigenous) practices. Others have sought to explain how African cultural practices (music, religion, dances) that were derided as primitive and uncivilized in the early twentieth century became &quot;nationalized&quot; and transformed into key expressions of national cultures in many Latin American countries.

Some of these invariants have yet to be rigorously defined, and part of the course will involve explaining some of the issues that remain to be resolved, and some possible approaches.&nbsp; Applications will include generalizations of the Weinstein conjecture, symplectic embedding problems, distinguishing contact structures, and calculating Gromov-Witten invariants by cutting along contact-type hypersurfaces.",,N,Y,81,MATH 287,13547,2015,2,25.0,3.0,12.0,4.7,5.0,5.0,5.0,,1.7,-1.0,4.0

The writings of the Greek founders, starting with Zeno of Citium in the early third century BCE, now exist only in quotations and paraphrases in later authors, but Roman Stoicism is well attested in complete surviving works of Cicero, Seneca and others. A version of Stoic ethics became something of a default guide to life for generations of well-born Romans.In this course we will read the main surviving texts of Stoicism, and examine Stoic ideas under the three headings of physics/metaphysics, ethics and logic. The Stoics developed the first detailed and systematic account of nature that can be thought of as materialist, and the first such account of ethics based on the idea of natural law. They also made the first and perhaps only significant advances in logic between Aristotle and the Middle Ages.",,Y,N,122,PHIL 105,13333,2015,1,9.0,8.0,88.89,3.2,3.6,3.5,3.4,5.0,4.7,-1.0,3.1

3966,Nietzsche,"Friedrich Nietzsche addresses some of the big questions of human existence in a profoundly searching but often disturbing manner that continues to resonate with many. Hardly any philosopher (except Karl Marx) has exercised such a far-reaching and penetrating impact on intellectual life in the last 150 years or so. He has influenced thinkers and activists across the political spectrum. Nietzsche has always been of special interest to young people who have often appreciated the irreverence and freshness of his thought, as well as the often very high literary quality of his writing. In this course, we explore Nietzsche&#39;s moral and political philosophy with emphasis on the themes he develops in his best-known and most accessible work, The Genealogy of Morality.&nbsp; The best-known themes from this book include the slave rebellion in morality, ressentiment, bad conscience, and ascetic ideals. However, we also read several other of Nietzsche&rsquo;s works, and do so chronologically (except that we begin with his auto-biography, Ecce Homo, which Nietzsche wrote briefly before his mental collapse in 1889).&nbsp; The others works include The Birth of Tragedy, The Gay Science, Beyond Good and Evil, and The Antichrist.

3972,Guilty until Proven Innocent. Finding Justice and Truth in the Middle Ages,"Diving into the world of medieval law and rituality, students will discover the &ldquo;Real Game of Thrones&rdquo;. We are going to explore concepts of justice and law, encompassing the first written laws from the time of the so-called Barbarian Invasions, Church law, and reminiscences of pre-Christian rituals. The place of the divine in search of truth and justice, of women in a male-dominated culture, of Jews in a world ruled by Christian sovereigns will be analyzed in particular.

3973,"Sex, Technology, and Trump: What Lies Ahead for The Constitution","Donald Trump&rsquo;s unexpected victory on November 8th represents a seismic shift that may soon affect&mdash;even during this semester&mdash;subjects including separation of powers, federalism, immigration, corruption, religious freedom, and freedom of speech: in short, all things constitutional. Yet, as unpredictable as the future may be, the decisions of the executive branch and the electorate remain constrained, at least in theory, by a legal system built on a Constitution that emerged from the social and political conflicts of eras long past. Students entering the Class of 2020 weren&rsquo;t alive when civilization-ending military conflagration seemed a real possibility, or when an American president was driven from office because of a scandal linked to hacking the opposing candidate&rsquo;s private information. Today&rsquo;s students cannot easily recall a time before the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the global responses they triggered. Nor can they imagine a world before the internet, social media, and interactive videogames, a world not immersed in images of sex and violence&mdash;a time more innocent, perhaps, yet in many ways more repressive. Social and cultural revolutions have upended the pace of political upheaval and conventional understandings of family, sexuality, and intimacy. Economic dislocation and a sense of exclusion have disrupted partisan affiliations. Scientific revolutions and technological innovations have provided new opportunities for communication and connection even as they have created new mechanisms for surveillance, profiling and control&mdash;at once improving democratic accountability and yet strengthening the state&rsquo;s grip and the prospects for tyranny. Adapting the words of this Constitution and the values it embodies requires analyzing the blend of politics and law practiced in and by the United States Supreme Court and influenced by popular culture and political discourse. This seminar, drawing on judicial opinions and secondary sources, will explore how our most basic legal framework, that of the U.S. Constitution and the law surrounding its interpretation and implementation, shapes and is shaped by modern forces battling for the character of the national soul.",Course open to Freshman Students Only,N,Y,56,FRSEMR 40F,13806,2015,2,13.0,12.0,92.31,4.8,4.9,4.9,4.8,4.7,3.9,-1.0,4.9
3974,Poverty and Development,"We will consider a number of important questions in the field of development economics: Why are some countries so rich and others so poor? What factors have determined which countries prosper? Can these factors be changed with specific economic policies? If so, what are they and how are they best implemented? Are there country-specific characteristics that determine economic fate? Or, is prosperity just the result of luck?&nbsp; Does the enjoyment of the rich somehow depend on the continuing suffering of the poor?",Course open to Freshman Students Only,N,Y,56,FRSEMR 40H,13852,2015,2,10.0,9.0,90.0,4.1,3.6,4.3,3.7,4.0,3.2,-1.0,4.2
3975,Personal Agency and Social Networks,"The study of social networks is vast, involving everything from the structure of ties among Facebook friends to the process through which people decide whom to ask for help. In spite of the popularity of social media and recent attention to network data by businesses, the study of networks has a long- standing history, with important contributions by anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists dating back to as early as the 1930s. This course examines two questions in that vast body of work&mdash;how people&rsquo;s behavior is affected by their networks and how they make decisions about how to use their networks.",Course open to Freshman Students Only,N,Y,56,FRSEMR 40R,13856,2015,2,9.0,6.0,66.67,3.8,3.3,3.7,4.3,4.7,2.8,-1.0,3.8

How should questions of well-being bear on one&#39;s reasoning about what to do, and on one&#39;s relations with other people? Can you assess your well-being by evaluating parts of your life individually, or does it depend on the shape of your life as a whole? Readings will include work by Richard Kraut, Derek Parfit, T. M.

3979,Love and Inner Conflict,"The most important feature distinguishing human beings from other animals is generally supposed to be a capacity for reasoning &ndash; about how things are, but also about what to do. It is clear, however, that no account of intentional human action that restricts itself to reasoning will be adequate. Much of what we do seems to be the outcome of some kind of inner struggle or conflict about what to do, or (in the more momentous cases) which path in life to follow, and sometimes we act in ways we know to be &lsquo;contrary to reason&rsquo;. It is not at all clear what&rsquo;s really going on when this happens.Plato (428-348 BCE), Augustine (354-430 CE) and Freud (1856-1939) offer especially interesting and plausible accounts of such inner conflict. In their different ways, they each understood such conflict in terms of the soul&rsquo;s having parts, or distinct faculties. They are also alike in positing a fundamental but highly plastic force in the soul, in terms of which its development or deformation, including its division into parts, can be understood. They all called this force love, although it is not straightforward what they meant, or whether they meant the same thing, by calling it that.In this course, we will look at these theories of the composite, love-driven psyche as expressed in various of their works, such as Plato&rsquo;s Gorgias, Symposium and Republic, Augustine&rsquo;s Confessions and De Trinitate, and Freud&rsquo;s The Interpretation of Dreams and The Ego and the Id.

To understand how this complex but unstable legal order was maintained and how competition for honor and power was kept within bounds, the seminar uses close readings, written analyses and class discussions of Icelandic family sagas, poems, historical narratives, and legal texts to study feuding and peacemaking, honor and shame, anger and hatred, kinship and marriage, gender, chieftaincy and clientage, gift-giving and plundering.&nbsp; It gives particular attention to the politics and group psychology of violent revenge and the roles of both men and women in containing it.

4029,Economic Justice,"Capitalism organizes society around individual pursuits of material gain. Capitalism seems to have won the great ideological struggle with other ways of organizing society. But there is much discontent: the Occupy Movement made clear that even Americans now care about excessive inequality, and many worry about the future in an increasingly economically divided society where access to technology richly rewards some to the exclusion of many others. Capitalism is also closely associated with what is arguably the biggest policy problem of the 21st century: climate change. So how can we justify capitalism?

Is rhetoric a regrettable feature of democracy, or a practice worth cultivating? We often denigrate rhetoric as pandering or manipulation. We often assume that stories, images, and metaphors intended to persuade a particular audience are, at best, adornments to the &quot;real argument.&quot; At worst, they are means of trickery, ways of moving people to a decision that their better reason would reject.But examples of great rhetoric force us to question this assumption. The speeches of political figures such as John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Martin Luther King arguably derive their moral force not simply from the principles they invoke, but from the way in which they appeal to the life circumstances of their listeners.We will examine the case for and against rhetoric by turning to classical texts (Aristotle, Plato, Hobbes, Kant), contemporary political theory (Garsten, Beiner, Chambers), and great political speeches (Douglass, Lincoln, Johnson, and others.)\t\t\t&nbsp;",,Y,N,136,SOC-STD 98OQ,13234,2015,1,8.0,7.0,87.5,5.0,4.7,4.7,3.8,5.0,5.2,-1.0,4.7

Students will read some classic autobiographies by African Americans (for example, those by Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, and Malcolm X), along with some lesser-known works (for instance, autobiographies by Ida B. Wells, Shirley Chisholm, and Amiri Baraka). They will discover how an influential set of black individuals, both men and women, came to political consciousness and participated in the collective struggle for justice in America. Students will reflect on these figures&rsquo; personal struggles to find meaning and solace under unjust conditions and to forge dignified modes of resistance. The seminar provides an opportunity to see how these personalities interpreted key events and periods in U.S. history&mdash;slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, the Jim Crow era, the two World Wars, the Great Depression, the civil rights movement, and the post-industrial urban crisis&mdash;as social actors who participated and lived through them. Close attention will be paid to their engagement with and contributions to the political traditions of liberalism, conservatism, socialism, black nationalism, and feminism.

4069,Time for Sleep: Impact of sleep deficiency and circadian disruption in our 24/7 Culture,"America is a sleepí¢íäåístarved nation. The Institute of Medicine estimates that between 50 and 70 million Americans are suffering from chronic sleep deficiency or sleep disorders, increasing their risk of weight gain, heart ailments, mood disorders, errors and catastrophic road accidents that kill more than 7,000 and maim more than 50,000 Americans annually. Children of all ages are sleeping about two hours less per night than they did in prior generations, rendering them hyperactive and irritable and compromising their ability to sustain attention and learn in school. This hyperactivity leads many sleepí¢íäåídeprived children to be misdiagnosed with ADHD and treated for years with amphetamines and other stimulants that further disrupt sleep. Yet, prevailing cultural attitudes lead us all to undervalue sleep and lionize allí¢íäåínighters, such that most patients with sleep disorders remain undiagnosed and untreated. This seminar will explore the function of sleep, the physiologic factors that regulate sleep and circadian rhythms, the impact of exposure to artificial light on sleep and circadian rhythms, historical and cultural differences in sleep habits, and the consequences of sleep deficiency, circadian disruption and sleep disorders on both the brain and the body. Public policy issues, such as school start times, limits on resident physician work hours, drowsy driving laws, and proposed regulations to screen transportation workers for sleep disorders will be debated. Students will be encouraged to track their own sleep patterns throughout the semester, identify the personal, structural and cultural barriers to maintaining healthy sleep while in college, and propose strategies to improve sleep health at Harvard College, the local community and the nation.",Course open to Freshman Students Only,Y,N,56,FRSEMR 22D,13770,2015,2,17.0,14.0,82.35,4.5,4.7,4.5,4.0,4.6,1.5,-1.0,4.6

Although most of its cities had been abandoned long before the arrival of the Spaniards in the Americas, a century of archaeological studies has revealed the world of the ancient Maya in unprecedented detail. New research methods and the decipherment of thousands of hieroglyphic inscriptions have led to recent advancements in our understanding of the indigenous history, society, politics, economy, and worldview. Rather than adopting a culture-historical narrative, this course is structured around several key problems and discussions including the emergence and the nature of statehood, relations with other Pre-Columbian civilizations of Central America, and the role of the environment in shaping and challenging the ancient way of life. The course will also address the issue of change and tensions in the paradigms of Maya archaeological studies as well as increased engagement with the indigenous communities.

How do professional communities determine when ideas are original, instead of misguided and infeasible? How does this compare across the arts, the economy, or the sciences? Specifically, the goals of the course are threefold: First, to acquaint students with key approaches on the subject in cultural sociology, economic &amp; organizational sociology, and the sociology of knowledge. Second, to discuss and deepen our understanding of what is specific about a sociological approach in comparison to other disciplines (e.g. psychology or economics), and thus to train the &quot;sociological imagination.&quot; Third, to equip students with broader skills for their own future academic and professional work.

But we will also be attentive to the role of ""reproductive prints"" as a mode of communication. In particular, the 18th century developing taste for drawings as collectibles gave rise to technical innovations in order to transmit the distinctive characteristics of drawings. The invention of lithography at the end of the century, and the development of a new kind of wood engraving, made possible an explosion of image production and creation of the illustrated press.

4137,Energy: Be the Change,"In the US, energy use creates large political and social tensions and&nbsp; much emphasis is placed on climate change.&nbsp; In China, health issues surrounding energy use are emerging as a critical issue. Importantly, there are many areas where the role of energy is often overlooked.&nbsp; A large fraction of current geopolitical tensions arise from issues originating in energy consumption, and that fraction may increase as water use and energy use become more closely tied. Too many discussions of energy focus on one feature of the problem, without considering how a change in one area will inevitably ripple out with the power to transform our relationships with each other and with the physical world.&nbsp; Some of those ripple effects are enormously positive, others are not. The goal of the course will be to choose energy changes that we would like to happen and to form a realistic plan for making that change occur.&nbsp; An important feature of the discussion will be considerations about what is physically possible; however, the major emphasis will be on trying to understand the connections that will be altered&nbsp; by that change.&nbsp; Any change, however laudable, inevitably creates both winners and losers. For change to happen, losers must at least be brought to accept the change. One goal of the course will be to establish local and global forums that allow us to learn more about people&rsquo;s reactions to proposals for energy change so that our proposals for change have a real possiblity of coming to pass.",Course open to Freshman Students Only,N,Y,56,FRSEMR 27K,12914,2014,2,7.0,4.0,57.14,4.5,3.7,3.8,3.0,5.0,1.8,-1.0,4.5

4139,Hiphop Activism: From Katrina to Ferguson,"This course examines how Hiphop political and social activism has changed how young Americans understand citizenship and active participation in society. We draw on prior research on youth activism in the U.S. and the racial and social class critique introduced in what is known as the `golden era' of Hiphop. The `golden era' occurred between the late 1980s and the mid 1990s. It is generally described as a period of experimentation in music and the introduction of socially conscious lyrics. It was during this period that social activists argued that Hiphop culture would lead to social change. In fact several Hiphop related organizations did develop including: Russell Simmons Hiphop Summit, League of Pissed Off Voters, Bad Boy's Vote or Die campaign and Black August. The overall influence of hiphop activism became apparent in 2005, when Katrina devastated the Gulf areas. For example, Lil Wayne's ""Tie My Hands"" told the heartbreaking, yet important, story of New Orleans' destruction after Hurricane Katrina and the political mismanagement that compounded the tragedy. The movement against police conduct in Ferguson has also resulted in Hiphop's response. While many are supportive, established leaders lament what they perceive to be a lack of leadership. This course addresses key questions: How do we define activism in the age of Hiphop? What is the relationship and differences between movements like Freedom Summer and Katrina and Ferguson activism. In addition to the traditional aspects of assigned readings, lectures and class discussions, this class will include a significant research component on Katrina and Ferguson protests. There will also be visits with experts in the field, and several activities beyond the classroom.",,N,Y,1,AFRAMER 151X,12917,2014,2,19.0,16.0,84.21,4.0,4.2,4.1,3.7,5.0,3.2,-1.0,4.3
4140,The Secret Sex Life of Anthropological Objects,"Objects in museum collections lead secret lives. Enmeshed in webs of sexed and gendered significance, they speak to hidden relations of desire and the erotics of power. There is a given-ness to museum display - to the selection of objects, the breadth of their claims for representativeness, the manner of their acquisition - that this course challenges using an interdisciplinary feminist lens. What does it mean to collect human cultural and biological history? What are the roles of gender, sex, and race in shaping the politics of anthropological collection and study? How are human differences measured, and what do these systems of measurement say about the process of scientific knowledge production?Convened at Harvard&rsquo;s Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology, this course invites students interested in gender, race, power, anthropology, history, biology, evolution, development, and public health, among other areas, to explore the ways in which notions of human difference influence and are shaped by the practices of anthropological study. We will examine how historical relations of gender, sex, sexuality, and imperial/racialized power continue to be narrativized, hidden, and excavated in historical and contemporary anthropological projects, exploring sex and sexuality as constitutive of other questions of inequality and violence that comprise feminist investigative enterprises.We will ground our investigation in the objects of anthropological analysis, the artifacts whose &ldquo;face values&rdquo; as things of interest to the scientific community conceal a history of struggle that includes eroticization of and violence against indigenous and colonized peoples. Chief among our goals is to work together to lay that complex, multilayered history bare. Our critique will extend to anthropology&rsquo;s deployment in contemporary contexts of international development, where the legacy of largely unidirectional scrutiny and classifications of bodies and peoples continues to haunt our present.",,N,Y,149,WOMGEN 2040,13495,2015,2,5.0,3.0,60.0,5.0,5.0,4.7,5.0,5.0,6.3,-1.0,5.0

Already, one&rsquo;s genetic background is used in making making life-altering health decision aimed at preventing the occurrence of cancer, as was recently the case with actor Angelina Jolie. This seminar will explore the extent to which current scientific knowledge can inform this type of decisions. The goals is to gain enough understanding of the scientific background to critically evaluate the discourse of a genetic counseling session. The course will proceed at first by laying essential foundations of genetic inheritance in humans; cancer evolutionary theories; statistical risk; and decision-making in health care. Subsequently student will read articles from the scientific and popular press, and listen to podcasts. In class we will discuss the readings. There are no strict prerequisites, though some familiarity with the basic concepts of probability and genetics will be very helpful. There is a good deal of reading and listening, which everyone is expected to do ahead of class. Students can expect readings in genetics and statistics that will stretch them, though it will not always be necessary to understand all the technical details of every paper. Students can also expect to read opinion pieces with which they (as well as I) may disagree. Students will be required to write two 5-page double spaced essays (midterm and final) and to lead a class discussion on the topic of one of their two papers.

4203,The Role of Government,"Economists have a very positive view of the role of markets. The intellectual foundations of this are the first and second theorems of welfare economics. The purpose of the seminar is to introduce the students to these results but also to their limitations. For example, for markets to work well it is essential to have a legal system that upholds contracts and protects property rights. The legal system is also important to deter crime. But who can provide the legal system other than a government that has the coercive power to raise taxes? The legal system is an example of a public good, but of course there are many others including national defense, clean air, etc. Markets under-provide public goods and they also do not work well in the presence of externalities, a highly topical example of which is global warming resulting from carbon emissions. Another very topical issue is inequality. There is no particular reason to think that a market economy will yield an equitable distribution of income, and given this what is the appropriate government response? Throughout the seminar the analysis of ideas and concepts will be interspersed with policy issues such as whether and what limitations should be placed on the right to smoke or consume drugs, the right to marry, the right to buy and sell organs, the right to bear arms, and the freedom of businesses to decide whom to serve. We will also consider the pros and cons of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the role of government nudges, and whether goods or services paid for by the government need to be produced by the government or can be outsourced: the issue of privatization.",Course open to Freshman Students Only,N,Y,56,FRSEMR 42C,13526,2015,2,11.0,9.0,81.82,3.9,4.3,3.9,3.4,3.8,2.8,-1.0,4.0
4204,"The Chinese Language, Present and Past","This course offers an opportunity to learn about the Chinese language in ways that will be of use both to prospective Chinese language learners and to students curious about the structure, history, cultural traditions, and social relevance of the language. Taking a partly hands-on approach, we will examine the fundamental principles that make up the sound system and govern the grammar of Mandarin, looking closely at its system of tones, its writing system, and the issues of Chinese as a heritage language. Looking deeper, we will see how the study of Chinese can contribute to understanding language as a central component of human cognition.",Course open to Freshman Students Only,N,Y,56,FRSEMR 33R,13600,2015,2,8.0,6.0,75.0,3.7,3.8,4.0,4.7,3.3,1.5,-1.0,3.7
4205,Exploring the Infinite,"Infinity captivates the imagination. A child stands between two mirrors and sees herself reflected over and over again, smaller and smaller, trailing off to infinity. Does it go on forever?&nbsp; &hellip; Does anything go on forever?&nbsp; Does life go on forever?&nbsp; Does time go on forever? Does the universe go on forever?&nbsp; Is there anything that we can be certain goes on forever? ... It would seem that the counting numbers go on forever, since given any number on can always add one.&nbsp; But is that the extent of forever? Or are there numbers that go beyond that?&nbsp; Are there higher and higher levels of infinity?&nbsp; And, if so, does the totality of all of these levels of infinity itself constitute the highest, most ultimate, level of infinity, the absolutely infinite? In this seminar we will begin our exploration of the infinite with questions like these. We will examine the different senses of the infinite by seeing how the infinite arises in many disciplines, from theology to the arts, from physics to modern mathematics. We will eventually focus on the infinite in mathematics and we will pursue its systematic study. But even here we are beset by difficulties. For there are so-called ``paradoxes of the infinite&#39;&#39;, paradoxes that have led some to the conclusion that the concept of infinity is incoherent. We will see, however, that what these paradoxes ultimately show is that the infinite is just quite different than the finite and that by being very careful we can sharpen the concept of infinity so that these paradoxes are transformed into surprising discoveries. We will follow the historical development, starting with the work of Cantor at the end of the nineteenth century, and proceeding up to the present. The study of the infinite has blossomed into a beautiful branch of mathematics. We will get a glimpse of this subject, and the many levels of infinity, and we will see that the infinite is even more magnificent than one might ever have imagined.",Course open to Freshman Students Only,Y,N,56,FRSEMR 23C,13777,2015,2,11.0,8.0,72.73,4.0,3.8,4.2,4.0,4.0,1.0,-1.0,4.0

Christians not only owned slaves, but they argued that slavery was sanctioned by the Bible. This course will explore the relationship between Christianity and slavery in America from 1619, when the first slaves arrived in Virginia, to the Emancipation Proclamation in 1865. We will ask several questions. How did white Christians become convinced that slavery was sinful? Why did many slaves convert to Christianity, the religion of their oppressors? How did enslaved Christians make sense of their suffering? Students will read major historical interpretations of slavery, but they will particularly focus on primary documents, including proslavery tracts and sermons, abolitionist speeches, poems, and the personal religious narratives of enslaved men and women. We will also read parts of Harriet Beecher Stowe&rsquo;s Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin, one of the most controversial novels ever published in the United States. In addition to discussing the readings during class meetings, we will listen to spirituals and analyze paintings, photos, and other objects (for example, abolitionist tokens).

The story of anatomy in National Socialist (NS or Nazi) Germany is an example of ethical transgressions in the anatomical sciences and reveals the complex relationship between anatomists and the Nazi regime. The historic causes of this development will be explored by examining the roots of the biologistic NS ideology in the connections between anatomy, physical anthropology, the global eugenics movement and German racial hygiene. Many anatomists became members of the NS party, while others were persecuted for so-called &ldquo;racial&rdquo; and political reasons. An examination of the history of anatomical body procurement from ancient Greece to the 21st century demonstrates the changes of the traditional sources of bodies for anatomical dissection under NS rule, resulting in the use of many bodies of NS victims for anatomical purposes. Anatomical research changed with the exploitation of the rising number of bodies of executed men and women. Case studies of the work of individual anatomists reveal a gradual shift in the paradigm of anatomy. A few anatomists left the traditional paradigm- i.e. the gain of anatomical knowledge through work with the dead- in favor of a new paradigm- i.e. work with the &ldquo;future dead&rdquo;- in human experiments on prisoners who were subsequently murdered.

4305,Risk and Intimacy,"How do individuals negotiate the pleasures and perils of intimate life? How are the individual decisions we make in our most personal relationships affected by the world around us? To what extent is our ability to feel and express affection, trust other people, and to maintain curiosity about and empathy for the experiences of those who differ from us impacted by structural inequalities and the constraints of culture? In this class we will examine the relationships between of ideas of risk and vulnerability and the ways individual people come to know, understand, depend on, cooperate with, protect, love, engage in sexual relations with, grieve and mourn other people. We will begin by examining these questions from a macro-structural level, with readings by Elizabeth Povinelli, Michael Warner, Judith Butler and Samuel Delaney on the relationship of governance to love and empathy, and Avery Gordon, Saidiya Hartman and Alice Goffman on the impacts of institutional violence on intimate relationships. We will then look at the ways different contemporary sexual communities manage emotional and bodily risk, with readings on BDSM by Leopold von Sacher-Masoc, Stacy Newmahr and Margot Weiss and readings on HIV/AIDS and gay male sexual subjectivity by David Halperin, Leo Bersani, Tim Dean and Michael Bronski. We will read texts on queer forms of intimacy like friendship, chosen families and nonmonogamous erotic attachments by Michel Foucault, Jamie Heckert and Dossie Easton. Finally, we will read a collection of first-person fiction and nonfiction accounts of navigating vulnerability and interpersonal intimacy in the digital age. Students will write a series of short reflection and reading response papers over the course of the semester and engage in a collaborative process of working to form an intellectually and interpersonally intimate learning environment with their peers.",,N,Y,149,WOMGEN 1470,13698,2015,2,16.0,12.0,75.0,4.2,4.0,4.4,3.9,4.2,4.8,-1.0,4.1

The creative and generative spirit of human thought and action is considered to bridge the dividing lines of cultures and nations. An emphasis on innovation and creative solutions has risen in the past decade, as global crises, such as climate change, economic instability, and epidemics, challenge life as we know it. In this class we examine the idea of innovation to explore its processes and politics. We explore both the potential and perils of innovation through specific case studies in technology, artistic endeavors, entrepreneurial initiatives, and everyday life.We approach the idea of innovation through a constellation of terms that accompany it: creativity, generativity, improvisation, ingenuity, entrepreneurism, and cultural and technological change. We will ask: Why and how do we innovate? What does it mean to innovate? What are the historical and geographic conditions and the tools and technologies that enable innovation? In this day and age of celebration of entrepreneurial activity and creative collaborations: we ask who is read as innovative and what are the limits of the innovative endeavor?The course begins with classic texts on creative processes to discuss the innovative human condition.

4334,Literatures of Excess in Modern China,"Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary &ldquo;excess&rdquo; that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime &ndash; in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction, poetry and drama, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality&rsquo;s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.",,N,Y,30,CHNSLIT 131,13750,2015,2,1.0,1.0,100.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,-1.0,5.0

This master narrative, however, suggests that early medieval Japan was steadily becoming a more patriarchal and male-dominant society. This obscures a more complex explanation of court politics and power relations. This storyline also dismisses the fact that royal women received a title of nyoin, which was the female equivalent to a retired male monarch. In this course, we will examine premodern Japanese kinship and kingship by exploring the history of royal women and supporters of the court, including female attendants, warriors, and local estate officials. Likewise, we will investigate how Heian and Kamakura court women managed to access power and pursued their own political, cultural, and religious goals although they were limited in obtaining official government posts.

4377,Comparative History of Women and Gender In East Asia up to WWII,"A comparative perspective is a challenging but important approach for studying women&rsquo;s andgender history; it helps us generate new questions by seeing things that have been taken forgranted. In this course, we will learn the histories of East Asian women by investigating changinggender roles and power relations from approximately 600 to 1945. Under important topics such asfemale rulership, legal rights, family, religion, and sexuality, we will compare experiences andrepresentations of Japanese, Korean, and Chinese women, to understand diverse but still sharedcultures from which East Asian women and men invented new customs and traditions.The relationship between authority and power is a central theme for this course. We first defineauthority and power. Then we will investigate historical cases in which women successfully orunsuccessfully used their authority and wielded power to accomplish their goals by negotiatingchallenges related to their gender roles and existing social expectations. Although we will focuson cases of women, we will compare those with other cases (men, transgenderism, etc.) to fullyunderstand complex authority-power relations.While examining course materials in a roughly chronological order, we will refer back topreviously discovered information and ideas by focusing on several important questions:1) Did women have legally or socially acknowledged rights?&nbsp; If so, what kinds of rights were they? How did women use&nbsp; them?2) When women lacked certain rights, under what circumstances did women still exercise power?And how?3) Is there an underlying force that tends to maintain gender disparity?

We will examine competing models of therapy, evaluate their scientific status, and dig into case examples of each. We will also explore hot topics in the field, including whether all therapies have about the same effect&nbsp; (the &ldquo;dodo bird&rdquo; hypothesis), whether internet-based therapies actually work, and how to get effective therapies to traumatized people in war-ravaged and low-resource countries.",Recommended: The Psychology Department requires completion of Science of Living Systems 20 (or equivalent) and PSY 18 before enrolling in this course.,N,Y,124,PSY 1857,13730,2015,2,20.0,16.0,80.0,4.0,4.4,4.4,4.6,4.0,4.9,-1.0,4.2

4455,Multimedia Experimental Theatre and Performance,"(Taught by Visiting Associate Professor Magda Romanska.) With Netflix, YouTube and other Internet services providing any type of entertainment on demand, in the privacy of one&#39;s own home, the ritual of going to see a live performance is becoming increasingly endangered. At the same time as our social and cultural habits are changing, the digital, new-media revolution is also changing the theatre-making process, accelerating the transformation towards non-linear, non-narrative, immersive theatrical experience that is increasingly reflective of a fragmented global cultural landscape and its audiences. As Robert Lepage put it: &quot;We are confronted with audiences whose narrative vocabulary has evolved. . . They can read stories backwards now, and jump cut, and can flash forward.&quot; The Multimedia Experimental Theatre workshop-style course will focus on multimedia theatre as symptomatic of postmodern &quot;disintegration of meaning&quot; of words, and concepts. The students will explore new ways of analyzing and developing multimedia narratives that move across different genres, incorporating both film, video and live performance. They will also map their own non-linear narratives based on found multimedia, classic texts and their own writing.",,Y,N,499,TDM 169DA,13036,2015,1,2.0,2.0,100.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,,2.5,-1.0,4.5

4468,Psychology of Dominance and Societal Structure,"Humans are social beings. We need to live in groups to survive and flourish. From living in tribes, the vast majority of populations have now developed into modern societies which nevertheless are fortified by social control and dominance.Modern societies differ greatly in how their hierarchies are organized, and how the inevitable group-based inequality is maintained. For instance, Scandinavian countries are often perceived as more egalitarian than the United States, which in turn is seen as more egalitarian than Burundi.In this class we analyze the differing degrees of inequality present within different societies and systematically explore the cultural mechanisms which contribute to the different hierarchies. We will use case studies, from the US, Burundi, and Western and Eastern European countries. We will draw from research in Psychology, Sociology and Political Science to address questions such as, what mechanism consolidate hierarchies? Among others, we will reflect how stereotypes, racism and sexism are used to strengthen existing structures and compare how they appear in different societies. We will ask, what mechanism can foster attitudinal and behavioral changes to overcome inequality and power disparity.In a group-based class project students will develop a research proposal to address how cultures manifest or change their internal structures.

4469,Bayesian Data Analysis,"&nbsp;Bayesian Statistics is becoming popular in Psychology and is certainly a direction where quantitative Psychology is going to move within the next few years. This class covers basic and advanced topics of Bayesian statistics in a very applied way with a strong focus on applications in&nbsp;Psychology (and Social Sciences in general). Formulas and technical details are kept on a minimum -- it is all about how to integrate Bayesian concepts into your everyday research.The first part of the course introduces students to the Bayesian paradigm of inferential statistics (as opposed to the frequentist approach everyone is familiar with). We elaborate on Bayes&#39; seminal theorem and introduce gently the core components of Bayesian inference:&nbsp;prior distributions, posterior distributions, and Bayes factors. Subsequently, we will learn about simulation based approaches for sampling posterior distributions. These are the infamous MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) techniques and have fancy names such as Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling.Then we are ready to actually do Bayesian inference and testing. We start with simple statistical tests and models such as t-test, ANOVA, and regression and compute them&nbsp; in a Bayesian way. We extend our modeling approach to generalized linear models (GLM) and a model family where Bayesian statistics turnsout to be super helpful: hierarchical (aka multilevel or mixed-effects) models.&nbsp;Finally, we focus on modern, more specific (psychometric) Bayesian methods such as multidimensional/multilevel item response theory (IRT), Bayesian latent variable&nbsp; models, latent Dirichlet allocations (LDA; as e.g. used in natural language processing), and Bayesian networks.All topics covered will be supported by corresponding computations and illustrations in R.

How can poetry draw inspiration from dance and use it as a model for formal experimentation? Through a hands-on engagement with a number of seminal texts, students will learn how dance can set words in motion&mdash;and how, conversely, words can deal with the challenge of representing subtle nuances of bodily expression. We&rsquo;ll focus on issues such as musicality and rhythm, free verse, meter and lyricism in poetry; broader attention will be given to inter-artistic borrowings, including synaesthesia (the blending of sensory modalities), ekphrasis (the literary imitation of a visual object), and Gesamtkunstwerk (the drive to achieve a total work of art).

These common experiences can be explained by self-regulation, an exciting yet elusive construct that has captured the attention of researchers across psychology. In this course, students will explore the widespread influence of self-regulation through diverse scholarly sources accompanied by spirited discussion. Spanning several subdisciplines of psychology to address its hottest topics from the theoretical and empirical lens of self-regulation, we will divide the course by its many domains of practical relevance (e.g., behavior, emotion, learning) and apply them to students&rsquo; own lives.","Recommended: The Psychology Department requires completion of Science of Living Systems 20 (or equivalent) and at least one foundational course from PSY 14, PSY 15, PSY 16, PSY18, or Science of Living Systems 15 before enrolling in this course.",Y,N,124,PSY 1557,13710,2015,2,21.0,17.0,80.95,4.8,4.7,4.8,4.9,4.9,4.1,-1.0,4.8

4520,Multilevel and Longitudinal Models,"Data often have structure that needs to be modeled explicitly. For example, when investigating students&#39; outcomes we need to account for the fact that students are nested inside classes that are in turn nested inside schools. If we are watching students develop over time, we need to account for the dependence of measurements across time. If we do not, our inferences will tend to be overly optimistic and wrong. The course provides an overall framework, the multilevel and generalized multilevel (hierarchical) model, for thinking about and analyzing these forms of data. We will focus on specific versions of these tools for the most common forms of longitudinal and clustered data. This course will focus on applied work, using real data sets and the statistical software R. R will be specifically taught and supported. While the primary focus will be on the linear model with continuous outcomes (i.e., the classic regression framework) we will also discuss binary, categorical, and ordinal outcomes. We will emphasize how to think about the applicability of these methods, how they might fail, and what one might do to protect oneself in such circumstances. Applications of hierarchical (multi-level) models will include the canonical specific cases of random-slope, random-intercept, mixed effect, crossed effect, marginal, and growth-curve models.","Recommended: Permission of instructor required.

4521,Multilevel and Longitudinal Models,"Data often have structure that needs to be modeled explicitly. For example, when investigating students&#39; outcomes we need to account for the fact that students are nested inside classes that are in turn nested inside schools. If we are watching students develop over time, we need to account for the dependence of measurements across time. If we do not, our inferences will tend to be overly optimistic and wrong. The course provides an overall framework, the multilevel and generalized multilevel (hierarchical) model, for thinking about and analyzing these forms of data. We will focus on specific versions of these tools for the most common forms of longitudinal and clustered data.

The overall goal of this tutorial is to focus on a single subject, a single chemical neurotransmitter, and remaining on that topic to proceed through three phases of study, as follows. First, to orient students to tools from multiple traditional disciplines: synaptic mechanisms of neurotransmission, neuropharmacology, behavioral pharmacology, neuroanatomy, and psychiatry. Second, to elicit interest and curiosity through examples of specific and important disease states: Parkinson&#39;s Disease, Schizophrenia, and Drug Addiction. Third, to gain an historical perspective up to and including a current and sophisticated consensus (i.e., review articles of recent years). Socratic debate will be prioritized in the classroom.

4545,Law and Society through the Cinematic Frame,"In this seminar we will explore the interaction of law and society using the lens of film. The cinematic experience has become a key site through which the public understanding of law is produced, debated and influenced. Driven first and foremost by market and audience considerations, law related films often inject drama, contentious dimensions and even misrepresentations into the portrayal of real events. Nonetheless, by raising awareness about legal themes that pervade the plot, these films offer valuable insights toward discovering social scientific perspectives on the manner in which law functions in everyday life. Hence, the seminar will not focus on legal doctrine or teach you the fundamentals of the legal profession. Rather, using films as a framework for discussion, we will study law&rsquo;s working in relations to the social, political, economic and cultural environments in which it operates. Central thematic topics to be discussed include: the relationship between law, justice and morality; how does law intervenes in social relations and whether it is over-utilized as part of these relations; the dynamics between law and social change; is access to the legal process equal to everyone; and the function of law in deeply divided societies. Throughout the semester film viewing will occur outside class as part of your weekly preparation for the seminar.

While this image is only rarely an accurate representation of the scene, maritime archaeologists use the information from shipwrecks, submerged settlements, cargo deposits, wharves and other shoreline sites to piece together a story about the people who sailed the ships, built them, loaded their cargo, and much more. In doing so we give a voice to the often undocumented, silent majority: the sailors, laborers, passengers, and shipwrights who speak to us only through the artifacts they left behind.This class will introduce the field of maritime archaeology, including its history, procedures, and the information we can learn from both a sunken vessel and the artifact assemblages from a maritime site. Students will have the opportunity to have a hands-on experience using a remote-operated vehicle (ROV), and we are planning to visit an active local shoreline excavation site. We will also use museum collections on shipbuilding and maritime culture to learn more about different seafaring traditions.

This course explores the complex relationship between women&mdash;as authors, reviewers, readers, and consumers&mdash; and periodicals, beginning in the eighteenth century, when rising literacy rates ad advances in printing technology saw a huge rise in magazine circulation. Then, as now, magazines provided a platform for many women to share their writing; they also, however, often perpetuated problematic gender stereotypes and derogatory images of women. We will read pieces by and about important women writers, including Eliza Haywood, Mary Robinson, and Mary Wollstonecraft, as well as contextualizing materials, to consider questions such as: what differentiates a &ldquo;women&rsquo;s&rdquo; (or &ldquo;men&rsquo;s&rdquo;) magazine from any other kind of magazine? Are magazines inherently literary, inherently commercial, or both? How do magazines challenge or perpetuate popular discourses about the body?

Has the twentieth century witnessed the secularization, or &ldquo;de-Christianization,&rdquo; of American politics, or have reports of religion&rsquo;s decline in American public life proved premature? Might we even be seeing a concerted effort to re-Christianize American public culture? If so, will this effort gain momentum from, or run aground on, America&rsquo;s ever-expanding religious diversity?

4584,From Soul to Personality: Religion and Modern Psychology,"Critics and religious adherents alike have used psychology to understand religion for centuries. Some argue that knowledge of the human mind can &ldquo;explain away&rdquo; religion while others argue to the contrary that it buffers religious belief. This course will consider different ways that modern psychology has impacted thinking about religion in the Modern West. We will discuss the rise of empirical psychology, psychoanalysis, new interest in the &ldquo;personality,&rdquo; and the making of a field of the psychology of religion.

4595,Asteroids and Comets,"Comets have been seen regularly since before the beginning of recorded history. They have oftenbeen regarded as disturbing portents. Asteroids, on the other hand, were not discovered until the 19th century, with the advent of astronomy with telescopes. Today we know of many more asteroids than comets, but we believe that there are vastly more comets than asteroids in the solar system.This seminar will start with the history of the study of comets and asteroids, including the &ldquo;Great March Comet of 1843&rdquo;, observations of which led to the establishment of the Harvard College Observatory and its Great Refractor, at that time the largest telescope in the Americas. Our understanding of comets advanced dramatically in 1950 with the publication of two extraordinary papers: Whipple (then at Harvard) described the mixture of dust and ice that comprises the nuclei of comets, and Oort (Leiden University) showed that new comets enter the inner solar system from a vast, diffuse cloud surrounding the planetary system.&nbsp; Modern telescopes and spacecraft encounters provide us today with a wealth of information about comets and asteroids. We will examine these observations and learn what is known and what is inferred about the origin and structure of asteroids and comets.
